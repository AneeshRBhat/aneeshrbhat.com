It’s a hot afternoon in the summer of 2016. I’m visiting my village with my family. Everyone’s lazing around, with not much else to do. I see that my uncle has an interesting new device I’d never seen before. It was a Kindle, the electronic reader. By that time (I was probably eleven or twelve years old), I had been taken by the magical voodoo devices known to man as books. I loved reading. I asked my uncle for the kindle and began fiddling with it, figuring out how everything works. I came across some obscure sci-fi titles that my uncle read (and some of which I would also read in a few years), and then came across a title that seemed familiar: The Martian. The cool movie I’d seen about the astronaut getting stuck on Mars had a book? I had to check it out.

And before I knew it, the book had taken me. For a young me, it was unfamiliar territory. In retrospect, the book was way too mature for a kid my age. It was the first time I encountered profanity in a book. Very creative profanity, might I add, which amused me a lot at the time (and still does today). It had vocabulary that was way too advanced for me (Thank God for the built-in dictionaries on Kindles). Certain paragraphs flew right over my head. I must have read and reread certain sections repeatedly just to understand what they meant. And it became clear why that was the case, after I reread it again recently. The book belongs to the hard sci-fi genre. It is a subgenre of science fiction that emphasises on scientific accuracy and logic (And I didn’t even know that the mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, back then).

Finally, I don’t know how many days later, I finished the damn book. And what an experience that was. Having watched the movie previously helped me a lot, because I was able to anchor the events in the book to the events in the movie. But I still remember my experience with the book being much more profound than my experience with the movie. 

A good marker for how good a piece of content is probably its revisitability. How much would you be willing to invest your time in it again and again? I would go on to read the book and watch the movie several times later, as I grew older. It was fun each time. Seeing Mark Watney struggle against the hostile planet, in a bid to get back home after he was left behind by his crew, presumed to be dead. The Martian, if you consider that metric, might just be one of the best pieces of fiction I’ve ever consumed.

That goes for the movie too. I recently rewatched the movie, some five or six years later, and it still had the magic. It’s a mix of nostalgia and the fact that the movie is just that good. Everything from the casting, to the music. The visuals, the pacing, and the cinematography all tie in to make a timeless movie. 

## The Casting

The casting in this movie is perfect. Every actor fits the character they’re playing. Even when reading the book, in my mind, Jessica Chastain is Commander Lewis and Matt Damon is Mark Watney. I could never picture their characters as anyone else. Jeff Daniels provides the authoritative command required for the character of the NASA Director, Teddy Sanders. Sean Bean, provides justice to the defiant Mitch Henderson, who just wants to do right by the Ares III crew. Kristen Wiig also shines as the ever PR-conscious Annie Montrose. Even Donald Glover who has a small role, playing Rich Purnell does a great job as comedic relief. The casting works. No one seems out of place.

And of course, we have to talk about the main character - Mark Watney. Watney can be described best using the Hindi slang ‘*Bakchod*’. Google translates the word to 'nonsense'. But in more common use cases, it's used to describe a person who can find humor in an adverse situation. A person who weathers storms with a laugh. Who doesn’t take shit more seriously than they’re required to. Mark Watney is that guy (As mentioned even in the book, during a TV interview scene with psychologists who worked with the astronauts). Watney, in the book, was chosen for the Ares III mission mainly due to his ability to keep the fabric of the team together. 

Matt Damon becomes Mark Watney. He, in a way, carries the movie through its running minutes. The ‘Earth’ scenes are accompaniments to Watney’s situation on Mars. A lot of dialogues in the book and the movie is Mark talking to the camera, while recording a log on the Hab or in the Rover. To do that, and still keep the audience interested is no mean feat and Damon does it spectacularly.

## The Music

Composer Henry Gregson-Williams provides an eerie, atmospheric score that portrays Mark Watney’s solitude. Unlike Hans Zimmer’s brass and string-heavy tracks in the Christopher Nolan movies, particularly Interstellar (another movie where Matt Damon appears), the Martian’s soundtrack is somber and light, and yet carries emotional weight. As Mark drives through the Martian terrain from his home base- Acidalia Planitia to the Ares IV base at Schiaparelli crater, an emotional score plays in the background, reminiscent of the toll this ordeal has taken on not only the stranded astronaut, but also everyone back home working tirelessly to bring him back. 

But the light-heartedness and energy ever present in the movie is accentuated not with a background score, but with timeless pieces of music from a bygone era. A running gag in the movie and the book is Mark shitting on Commander Lewis’ disco music collection. Unfortunately, that is probably the only music he has available. Imagine being stuck on Mars with ABBA’s *Waterloo*, or Donna Summer’s *Hot Stuff*.

The more uplifting pieces in the movie’s soundtrack play during the most hopeful moments of the movie. Particularly, David Bowie’s *Starman*, which plays during a montage of the Taiyang Shen being prepared for a resupply mission to the Hermes while Mark modifies the rover for his long journey ahead, with instruction by the smart folk back home. It’s truly magical, enough to make you shed a tear. Not in the least because the song is amazing, but also because of the significance of the scene. The crew breaks the news to their families, that they’re potentially going to be spending an additional 500 days in space, with their lives at constant jeopardy. Yet, they laugh and they express their love for each other. Because, as the lyric from the song goes,

> ‘He’s told us not to blow it, ‘cause he knows it’s all worthwhile.’  

Two nations, although working together to, in part, serve their own self-interests, but working together nonetheless to preserve the spirit of space exploration. 
And in the very end, as if to surmise the entire movie, Gloria Gaynor’s I will survive plays, as the credits roll. The song itself is about heartbreak and abandonment by a loved one, but in Mark Watney’s case it describes his will, with which he did survive on the unforgiving planet and returned home safely.

## Cinematography and Visuals

The Martian has one of the best visual effects out of recent space movies. And it makes sense. Much of the movie features said visual effects. 
A large chunk of the Mars scenes is based in the Hab- Watney’s home for the time he’s stranded on Mars, or at least with the Hab in the background. The white-canvas-walled habitat is airy and spacious. With good reason too. Remember, it was supposed to house six astronauts for about a month. Laden with terminals and screens, tables placed in the center with various apparatus on them, the first time we really see the Hab (when an injured Mark enters it and provides himself with medical attention), it immediately throws in the midst of an exoplanetary habitat that was haphazardly abandoned by its dwellers. 

The Rover, MAV, and the Hermes all look spectacular. As a person who loves the book, these elements as shown in the movie is what I imagine when reading the book too. The Hermes looks like the International Space Station, if it had more lengthwise growth and took steroids. Again, this is a craft that is supposed to be used by six people over a span of 3 years, on and off. Also, it’s what facilitates all the Ares missions. It has to look like it can do the job, and they have made it so. It’s hard to describe a spaceship, or any sort of vehicle that is not already embodied in the collective consciousness of the audience. Andy Weir did a good job of describing the functionality of each of these vehicles. But Ridley Scott and Co. really brought these to life. 

There can be made a case that good movie adaptations are supposed to do just that: bring the words to life. That might seem obvious, but we can recount several instances of a good book ruined in the adaptation simply because it was not faithful, not just to the story, but also to the world of the book: its rules, its characters, and its soul. The Martian, is a good adaptation because it does bring the world, the characters and the underlying tension and levity of the plot to life. 

In the book, most of the 'Mark scenes' are written from a first-person perspective. Mark is logging his activities into a log, and by that medium he talks with the reader. The movie naturally could not recreate that without weirding the audience out too much (Imagine if all Watney scenes were him monologuing into the camera). But they integrate that aspect of the story with the regular third-person shots quite well. Whenever Watney’s talking, he’s usually talking to the video log, either in the Hab or the Rover. But we also see him spreading soil, treating his shit to make fertilizer, lugging stuff around, digging, drilling, driving and a host of other activities he has to do to survive. 

During the course of the movie, the makers established another important character. Mars itself. The angry red planet that is intent on fucking up Mark’s efforts to get home. The loneliness of being the only person on a planet that is hostile to your kind. The long shots of the Martian terrain as Mark drives the rover through it. The tall mountains ever present in the background of the Hab. The storm that caused the Ares III mission to get scrubbed, and which nearly killed Mark and left him stranded on the planet. The planet’s low gravity (which the makers actually portrayed by altering Damon’s movements). All these things and more cascade to establish the Red Planet as a character in its own right. Silent, but ever-present. Arid, desolate, and hostile, Mars, in the wrong circumstances, is an astronaut’s worst enemy.

That is all about the movie, for now. I’ll be doing a deep dive into the story itself in the next post where I’ll simultaneously be analyzing the book. We’ll look at what the book does that the movie chose to leave out, what I think about certain creative decisions, and why the book remains one of my favorite pieces of fiction, all these years later.
