# About Me

My name is Aneesh and I'm a writer, programmer and a soon-to-be physics major. I like thinking and writing about Science, the Universe, existentialism, and death. Most of my writing also revolves around these things.

I love watching movies and reading books. And I like people who like these things as well. So if you do, reach out to me. I'm currently doing a run of Quentin Tarantino's movies, so that I can say that I've watched all of his oeuvre before his next and final movie. 

I'm also working on a sci-fi novel right now. It's my first time writing a long-form piece of content, so it's a bit back-breaking but I expect to be done by it by 2024 (That is if I don't procrastinate or don't abandon it altogther).

I hope to release a new post on this blog once or twice a week. The blog itself will be improved over-time since it's me writing the code for it. You can view the source code on my GitHub.

Lastly, if you want to reach out to me you can do so on my email aneeshbhatr@gmail.com

Thanks a lot for checking my tiny corner of the internet out. I hope you have a brilliant day and a brilliant life.
