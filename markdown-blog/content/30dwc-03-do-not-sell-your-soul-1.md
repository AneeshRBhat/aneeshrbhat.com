## I repeat do not sell your soul

But first what does selling your soul even mean? It means doing things for others’ approval. You may say you don't do that, but let's do a bit of inventory shall we? An inventory of your motivations.

Why do you do what you do? You may be a student, or a person in a job, or an entrepreneur or a stay-at-home parent, or something else. Whatever you do, what is your reason behind doing it? There might be a variety of answers to this, but the most common ones would probably be: to make money, to provide for someone you’re responsible for, to just have fun, or to prove something to someone . I want to tackle the last bit here.

Many people are hurt by someone. Someone in their childhood didn't believe in them, or a romantic partner left them because they were lacking in some aspect, or someone rejected them. And that incident becomes a huge source of motivation for them. And it does drive them to work very hard and achieve that thing that they lacked. But I think that's not a very good motivation to do stuff. 

We have heard of people pleasers. People who go along with anything and everything other people say and do and never utter the word 'no' or stand up for themselves, because they have a desperate need to be accepted and validated by others. But how are the people I mentioned earlier any different from others? Sure, they don't outwardly display their people-pleasing behavior, but their inherent motivations are still to be validated by the same people they want to prove something to. They may say things like “They'll see one day” or “I'll show them”. But I have a question for them? Why?

Why do you want to prove something to someone? Why do you want others to acknowledge something about you? Do you see it, this is implicit people pleasing. Only here, you secretly view the same people as some sort of antagonists who you have something to show. Maybe you fantasize about them begging for forgiveness and finally accepting you.

And that is when you sell your soul. Not to the devil. But to people. You model yourself in a way that you think will best 'prove' 'them' wrong, all the while losing your own self. You sell your soul to please the same people who you think have hurt you by telling you that you aren't enough. And the fact is, those people don’t even give a shit about you.

I'm not saying that working towards something or doing something good for others is bad. But you should always keep your motivations in check. What are you doing whatever you're doing for? Are you doing it to find meaning in life? Are you doing it in service of God? Are you doing it to protect and nurture those around you? Or are you doing it to take some kind of silent revenge in your mind? Are you doing it to 'prove' something to somebody so that they will finally accept you? Don't you think that's a shitty motivation to do things?

And this is where I have a problem with a lot of the red-pill stuff on the internet as well. The 'gurus' give advice to young people, men usually, to go to the gym, or to learn a skill so they can earn money or to start a business. Good stuff, although they are devoid of nuance. But the problem starts where they disclose the motivation to do these things. Usually, it's so that they can get women to go out with them or hookup with them. And that's where all their advice goes down the drain, at least for me.

Self betterment is a wonderful path to walk on, no doubt. We are imperfect beings and we should aim to become better. We should slay the demons within us and make our mind and body beautiful. Because that's a journey unto the self. It's a path where we'll discover ourselves and learn what will bring us peace and joy in life. But when you make it about getting women to sleep with you, you have tread a noble path and littered it. 

I believe that most things we do should not have any grand purpose attached to them. We should mainly do things for the sake of doing them. Of course, there are exceptions, but I believe this is a good way to live life. Do things because they give you meaning. Not because they'll make you tons of money and you could buy a car. If you go deep into your motivations, you'll find that most of them probably have something to do with security, sex or as I mentioned earlier, 'proving' something to somebody, which is just your ego talking. 

So I'd ask you to introspect. Why do you do the things you do? Who are you trying to prove something to? Why do you want their approval? And would you be better off not being an implicit people pleaser?

Save your soul. Because without it, you're nothing.
