This week certainly has been interesting. 

## College admissions. 

I got into a college. Yay! I learnt two things during the admission process. i) Merit gets you things, more often than not and ii) never trust online payment portals that are set up by government authorities, cause they’ll cause you a lot of pain. 

## Duress under distress.

This ties into my conception of god that I’ve been thinking about. When the situation is not under your control, the best you can do is control what you can: yourself. This pertains to my post: [If you’re drowning, make a lot of noise](https://aneeshrbhat.netlify.app/post/1684300740).

## Why I’ll start eating home cooked meals more.

I got an upset stomach for a few days after I ate something from a restaurant. Now, I have a weird thing with food where if it causes some kind of problem in my body, I stop eating it altogether because I fear a psychosomatic response. That’s why I don’t eat pineapples anymore after I had a bad experience with it. Home cooked meals never do that to me, so I’m going to stick with home cooked meals more.

## I put down a book, I picked up a book

I was reading the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy (in five parts) but at a certain point during the third book, it got too difficult to get through. It was probably because I got disconnected from the book or the book became boring. But I put it down and have started a new one. [Quarter Share](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2334538) by Nathan Lowell. It’s been good so far. It’s a small book, by the looks of it. I expect to be done with it in about 3-4 days and I’ll continue with the rest of the series, if I like the first book. 

## My morning routine has gone to the dogs, and I hope to start it again. 

I consistently wrote first thing in the morning and meditated later for about a month. But in the last week, that has not been happening. It was the ill health, the college admissions and now some other shit. But yeah, I expect to start again next week and keep it up.

# What I’m doing next week.

* I’m going to restart writing my novel. I’ve written about 10000 words and the first chapter is almost done. I’ll devote a good amount of time in developing it so that I’m done with the first draft by the end of the year or earlier
* I’m going to start learning computer science from this course. It’s probably going to be a 2-3 year commitment, that is if I decided to go through with it after the initial few days of doing it. I’m no stranger to computer science and programming; I studied it as one of my subjects in pre-university college and I have been coding on and off for about five years now. Recently I built my blog + personal website, aneeshrbhat.netlify.app. But I want to learn CS at a deeper level because I like the subject.
* Continue the 30 day writing challenge. I hope to build a repository of ideas about what I can write about and not procrastinate till the end of the day and hurriedly  write something and publish it. I would like to be more intentional with my online writing.

That’s it for this week’s review. See you in the next one.
