# If you're drowning, make a lot of noise

I recently got into a sticky situation where a large amount of money got stuck in processing and that caused me a lot of stress and anger. While I did make sure to tell myself that in these situations, where you don’t have any control over the turn of events, the only thing you can do is stand your ground and keep calm, I also learnt the importance of seeking help.

As the title suggests, if you’re in a sticky situation where it seems like you can’t do much, i) Stay calm. Everything will turn out the way it needs to, which is to say we can’t do jackshit as to how history ultimately unfolds; and ii) Do everything you can to fix the situation. That involves seeking help.

How my situation eventually got solved was a few people, who I approached, pulling some strings to solve my problem. They were complete strangers and yet they stuck their necks out for me. I don’t know why they did that, but it’s, for me personally, a testament to human kindness that still exists, despite what we see on the internet.

So that’s it. If you find yourself drowning, make a lot of noise. Eventually a kind person will stop to help you.
