God; The man up above; The omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent entity that has been a part of human culture possibly since it's beginning. God is perhaps the most important thing in some people’s lives, so much so that they base major life decisions off of the word of God and sometimes dedicate their whole life in service of god. I’m sure those of you reading this believe or in some point in time used to believe in God. You can deduce from the title that I don’t. I don’t know if I ever have. 

I’ve always been pretty ambivalent about God’s existence. Growing up, I don’t recall a period in my life when I actively believed in a higher power. I saw no rationale in performing religious duties, so I did them out of compulsion, half-heartedly. I was never too keen on visiting temples and such because I saw them as a drag, as opposed to me sitting comfortably at my home.

Now, I have realized I have no utility for God and Religion in my life. The question of God’s existence doesn’t bear any effect on my life. I can go so far as to say, God can reveal themselves tomorrow and I still won’t find myself worshipping them. I live as if God doesn’t exist.

Here are the reasons why.

## God is a terrible morality check

Morality. That thing religions try and teach us by packaging them as words of God. We’re taught as kids a specific set of actions that are good and bad. Which actions will get you in the good graces of God and which actions will incur his wrath. For a kid - who doesn’t have an innate sense of morality, i.e., who can’t tell right from wrong - This is a maybe a good strategy to keep them in line. You tell kids, God will punish you if you lie, or if you steal or if you commit any other immoral action. Kids being kids are afraid of punishment, and especially punishment from a guy they have never seen, so they comply. But as adults or people who have, to some extent, developed an innate sense of what is right and what is wrong, is this how we should still be expected to stay in line?

The binary of good and bad they taught you as a kid is a myth. The world does not work on binaries. It’s filled with nuance. Granted, some things including rape and murder are definitively bad things and people who do them are scums of the earth. But there’s also a lot of grey we’re not taught to see. One example of this is a man stealing food to feed his starving children. According to our childhood binary morality, we might see the man as a ‘bad’ person for stealing or a ‘good’ person for doing whatever it takes for his children. But a grown up would think twice before pronouncing such moral judgements. 

I am not arguing for subjective morality: The idea that morals are human-made and there is no absolute right or absolute wrong. I do agree that there is a universal moral code, and many religions do share some essence of it. But we don’t need God to imbibe these morals within us.

You’re taught that after you die, you’ll be held accountable for your actions on Earth. Hence the more ‘good’ you do, the better your afterlife will be. Conversely, the more ‘bad’ you do, the worse your afterlife will be. Think heaven, paradise, hell and purgatory. Think eternal damnation and the pearly gates. Think Angels and Demons.

But is that not a terrible motivation to do ‘good’? Is being kind, generous, honest, charitable, compassionate and non-violent just for the sake of a supposed positive end result the right way to go about it. Being virtuous should be for the sake of it. These values are self-sufficient. Any decent individual (I define a decent individual as someone who is not a narcissistic psychopath and doesn’t cause voluntary harm to other beings) would, to some extent, subscribe to these values. I consider myself a decent person, in that I try my best to imbibe these values into my own life. But I don’t need the concept of God to enforce these values into my life; I do it because it elevates the ability of me being able to live with myself. It helps me sleep better at night, knowing that my life has a net positive effect on others.

In the same vein, not doing ‘bad’ or morally dubious actions just because you fear an ultimate punishment is in itself morally dubious. What I hear in that statement is that you would do those immoral things, like lying, stealing, harming others etc., if no one was watching. But morality should be independent of the outcome of your actions. An immoral action is, well, immoral even if no one is watching to hold you accountable for it. I personally mostly refrain from doing actions that I consider immoral because they would affect the previously mentioned ability to live with myself and to go to sleep peacefully at night; I will be held accountable for them at the highest court in existence: my conscience. 

You may say, no action is without motivation. In that case, the only acceptable motivation for being moral is to achieve inner peace: that aforementioned ability to live with yourself.

## Most conceptions of God are dumb

In most versions of God, He (generally a ‘He’) is narcissistic, needy and immature. Basically a person who’s just hit puberty. Most things God tells us, usually go something like.

- If you don’t believe in me, you’re suffering for eternity.
- If you believe in other Gods, you’re suffering for eternity.
- If you don’t prostrate before me and worship me regularly… you get the point

So basically we’ve got Donald Trump from The Apprentice. But instead of saying ‘you’re fired’. He’s sending you towards eternal damnation.

You would assume that a being that literally created the entire universe with a single utterance would be more secure with themselves so as to not need a bunch of ephemeral, dumb apes to acknowledge their presence. But no, God needs us to submit to him and he needs us to sing praises of him.

It’s often said, God created us in his image. But it’s perhaps the other way around. We created God in our image. That’s why He looks like a human in our imagination and behaves just like a human. I am reminded of that family guy bit where a man about to be bitten by a snake says, “If Jesus exists, I will not die”. But then the snake says, “If snake Jesus exists, he will die”. Then, a nearby tree says, “If tree Jesus exists, both of them will die”. Then a flash of lightning snaps a the tree in half and kills the man and the snake and the tree says, “Thank you tree Jesus”. We’re so utterly lacking in our imagination that our God looks just like us. Hinduism is better, in that we have gods of all shapes, sizes and species. 

## ‘God did it’ is garbage answer to the fundamental question

Humans are curious creatures. It is our ability to ask questions and pursue their answers that allowed us to unravel the very nature of the universe. But at some point in time, we inevitably hit a roadblock. The fundamental Question: Why is there something rather than nothing? Why does anything exist? Even better: How does anything exist? This is something that we haven’t been able to answer, at least with the scientific method. Perhaps, we will never be able to answer it. This leaves a gaping void in our understanding of the universe and it causes us to answer it with, what I consider is an intellectually garbage answer: ‘God did it’. There is something rather than nothing because God wished that there be something rather than nothing. For one, it’s non-falsifiable. We cannot prove that claim otherwise. Also, the natural next question would be, “Why and how does God exist?” to which people respond in two ways. You have the initial ‘God has always existed’ and if you insist on further questioning, your head separated from your torso, usually by means of a sharp object.

Why not be intellectually honest and say, “We don’t know.” It’s not as comforting as the other answer, I know. But as exurb1a said, it’s better to have questions we can’t answer than answers we can’t question.

## In conclusion

I have very little knowledge of science, and barely any of religion. This essay is not meant to convert you into an atheist nor is it any meaningful critique of religion. This is my attempt to question notions that go unquestioned, mostly for myself. I don’t know if God exists or not. All I’m saying is, the answer to that question does not matter to me. Agnosticism is often associated with sitting on the fence, being in neither camp fully: be it the religious one or the atheistic one. But both positions are two sides of the same coin; Atheists and Religious people both center their beliefs around one idea: God. The latter believe in the validity of it and the former negate it; Both doing it with equal passion. What I’m doing is defenestrating that idea altogether. I’m proposing that we live as if God doesn’t exist. I’m proposing that we become masters of our own morality; That we become less fearful of ideas that loom the threat of divine punishment over our heads for thinking critically about those ideas; That we become comfortable with not having answers to every question we pose and yet don’t ever give up striving to find those answers. Finally, I hope that in this striving we find meaning, both for ourselves and all of humanity.
