# Hi, I'm Aneesh

This website serves as a platform for me to explore my interests, through my writing and whatever else I decide to do on this. Check out the Blog page to read my essays and stories. To know more about me, check out the About page. 

My non-fiction writing usually centers around subjects of philosophy and Science. I would call myself an optimistic nihilist ([See Kurzgesagt's video on it.](https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14)). I believe that the universe is devoid of any inherent meaning and that's OK! We can have a laugh about that fact and have a jolly good time, for the short while we're here on earth.

My fiction writing is mostly science fiction, since I love that genre and my best work has been in the form of sci-fi stories. I prefer sci-fi where the world is somewhat a utopia, like the world of Peter F. Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga.

If you want to look at what I'm reading of late, you can check out the reading list down below (Click on the book icon.) 

Well, there's nothing more to say really. 

Cheers!
