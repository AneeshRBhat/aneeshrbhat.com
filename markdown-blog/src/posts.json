It's because it's only meant for people who took the pain of clicking on the second blog, which means that you ventured into the site a bit. That's my content strategy, lure people in with substandard stuff, and then give them the good stuff. You say that's counterintuitive, but I say that's genius.\r\n\r\nThat was the second post, don't bother reading the third. Bye."
